1. The friend keyword allows the friend class to access the
private data and methods from the class that declared it. 

2. The using namespace std; statement will possibly cause name 
collisions with other namespaces. If you put it in a header
file, it imports that namespace into any C++ that includes the header.

3. The first of the four ways is to return a reference to a class 
member. You set the member of the class using the set() method and 
then return that point. The second way is to return a copy of the 
object. This is inefficient because it creates a whole new object, which
is a copy of the object. The third way is to make the object on the heap,
which creates a whole new object that will not be lost when the method
returns. The last way is to use an argument and make the method void.
This is the best way to return an argument because you can pass any 
object as a reference into the argument and use the set() method, inside
of that method.

4. The mutable keyword will allow a variable to be modified in a 
const method. 

5. The first way is that you could have actual objects inside of a
class. This way works nicely because it creates the objects when an instance
of the class is created and it deletes them when that instance gets
deleted. The second way is to use references as function arguments in 
the constructor. This way, the references would not be owned by the class
they would have to be created and stored somewhere outside of the class.
The third way is using pointers in the class. This has the most flexibility
but the most difficult memory management.

6. A singleton is a class that only can have one instance ever.
