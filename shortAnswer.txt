2. a and b are not pointers in the function argument so the function would be 
returning a regular int rather than a pointer.

3. ptr is a pointer so there is a improper conversion from int* to int. 
change it to scanf("%d", *ptr);

4. (a) a pointer to an int
(b) a const int, so cant change the int variable
(c) a pointer to a const int, you can change the pointer but not the int that
the variable points to 
(d) a const pointer to a non const int 
you can modify the data it points to but not the pointer itself
(e) a const pointer to a const int, you can't modify either

5. The & returns a pointer to a variable and the * does the opposite.

6. const int* a is a pointer to a const int so you can change the pointer 
but not the int variable it points to
int* const b is a const pointer to a non const int, you can modify the data 
it points to but not the pointer
