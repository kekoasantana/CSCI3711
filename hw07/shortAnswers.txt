1. missing a semi-colon at the end of the class declaration.

2. this.x and this.y should be this->x and this->y because 
the this keyword is a pointer in c++ so it must be dereferenced
and the -> will dereference it. Another error is that it should be
Projectile::Projectile because it belongs to the Projectile class.
Another error is that it should be this->speed = speed; and 
this->velocity = velocity; not x and y. You would only use x and y 
if they were your arguments.

3. (a) a non-constant method that returns a pointer to a non-constant 
int and has a non-constant pointer to an int as an argument.
(b) same as above, except the non-constant method returns a constant
pointer to an int.
(c) same as b, except the method is constant instead of non-constant.
(d) same as c, except the pointer to the int as an argument is constant.
(e) same as d.

4. C++ strings are safer and more secure but C strings are more
light-weight so they perform better. 

5. References are automatically dereferenced, unlike pointers and 
once you initialize a reference, you cannot change what it points to. 

6. A destructor automatically deletes an object that was created
on the stack, which avoids memory leaks.
