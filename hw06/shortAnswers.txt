1. Libraries are good because they are prewritten code that we can use so that we are not "reinventing the wheel" so to speak.
It speeds up time for writing programs.

2. The two kinds of libraries are static libraries and shared object libraries. Static libraries 
are linked and their object files become part of the executable. Shared object libraries, or 
dynamic linked libraries remain separate but the machine code is loaded by the executable at runtime.
